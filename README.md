This is a recreation of the provided mock-up located in this folder for reference.

Some differences include:
- The logo is different because it was provided and does not match the mock up.
- The font is slightly different
- The Graph includes a y axis for reference as well as a grid for readability
- The Months are abbreviated as in the mock, but also include the year for reference as the data spans 2016 to 2017.


What can you do?
- You can hide / show retail or wholesale sales data
- You can reorder the data in the table by clicking the column to manipulate data to sort ascending or descending based on the clicked column.

What is missing from this?
- Unit testing
- Default rendering in the case that the mocked API call fails
- Navigation based on the tags or product name to other potential sites.
